			<p>
				Many Canadians have a day off work on December 25 and many spend
				the day with close relatives or friends. It is customary to exchange
				gifts, enjoy a special festive meal and, perhaps, attend a special 
				church service.
				The traditions centered on Christmas gifts in Canada vary a lot 
				between families. In some families, a mythical figure called Santa 
				Claus brings gifts. He travels on a sleigh pulled by reindeer, enters 
				homes via the chimney and leaves presents and candy in Christmas 
				stockings or in a pile under the Christmas tree. In other families, 
				individual members exchange carefully selected gifts.

		   <p>
			  San Fermines festival is a week-long festival hosted in Pamplona, Spain.
			  It’s seen as one of the biggest festivals hosted in Spain every year.
			  It honours Spain’s first bishop Saint Fermin. For this event, over a 
			  million people flock to Pamplona each year. What can you look forward to? 
			  The well-known daily running of the bulls (encierro). Hundreds of men 
			  and women run for their lives in the narrow streets of Pamplona! They 
			  dress in white clothes and red sachets. How does it work? The idea is 
			  to touch the bull as it passes you or to hit it with a newspaper. Anyone
			  older than 18 can run and it’s completely free of charge! The festival 
			  is a true Spanish celebration. There’s so much to see and do… Live 
			  bullfights, flamenco music bands, fireworks, fairs, markets and parades. 
			  On July 7th everyone joins in a parade, walking with the 15th century 
			  statue of the saint.

			   The Winter Games, featuring sports that largely require snow and ice, 
			   draw a smaller field of competitors. But the competition for the gold, 
			   silver, and bronze is just as intense.
